 *
 * This API is automatically called the first time a hash update is performed,
 * however it is not thread safe.  To query capabilities in a thread-safe way,
 * and to report the selected algorithm to the user, please call this function

 * Since two 32-byte hash values take two SHA256 blocks to compress, with
 * padding, and the intermediate value with padding can fit in a single block,

 * because of various optimizations that are available due to the fixed format
 * of the input, this only requires about 2.32x more computation compared with a
 * single round of SHA256. In addition, various multi-lane optimizations are
 * available allowing for up to 8 hashes to be performed simultaneously on some
 * architectures.
 *
 * The origin of this primitive is in how Bitcoin and related projects construct
 * Merkle trees by performing double-SHA256 hashes of child leaf values to

 * This rather specialized API is used to compute multiple SHA256 compression

 * (e.g. proof-of-work), which can be done very efficiently by precomputing a

 * parallel.
 *
 * For maximum performance blocks should be a multiple of 8, as that is the
 * highest degree of parallelism on any presently supported architecture.
 *
 * Note that the midstate is delivered as host-ordered unsigned integers, the

 * hash.
